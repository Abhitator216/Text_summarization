# Text Summarization using NLP

## Overview

**What is text summarization?**

Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source text.

## Why automatic text summarization?

1. Summaries reduce reading time.
2. When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier.
3. Automatic summarization improves the effectiveness of indexing.
4. Automatic summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarization.
5. Personalized summaries are useful in question-answering systems as they provide personalized information.
6. Using automatic or semi-automatic summarization systems enables commercial abstract services to increase the number of text documents they are able to process.

## How to do text summarization

1. Text cleaning
2. Sentence tokenization
3. Word tokenization
4. Word-frequency table
5. Summarization

**Text variable**

```python
text = """
# ... (input text) ...
"""
```

# Let's Get Started with SpaCy

```python
# !pip install -U spacy
# !python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
import spacy
from spacy.lang.en.stop_words import STOP_WORDS
from string import punctuation
```

### Code Execution

The notebook demonstrates the application of text summarization using the SpaCy library in Python. It covers the following steps:

1. Loading and preprocessing the text.
2. Creating a word frequency table.
3. Assigning scores to sentences based on word frequencies.
4. Selecting the top sentences to form the final summary.

Please run the notebook cells in sequence to observe the complete process.

### Note

Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed, as mentioned in the code cells. The notebook uses SpaCy, so make sure to download the English language model (`en_core_web_sm`) if you haven't already.
